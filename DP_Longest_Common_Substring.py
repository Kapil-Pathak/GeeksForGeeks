"""
Given two strings X and Y. The task is to find the length of the longest common substring.

Input:
First line of the input contains number of test cases T. Each test case consist of three lines, first of which contains 2 space separated integers N and M denoting the size of string X and Y strings respectively. The next two lines contains the string X and Y.

Output:
For each test case print the length of longest  common substring of the two strings .
